# Random Chore Picker

## Im not good at helping my wife around the house... I just dont think of it like I should.
   - I created the app to give my wife a button to press to have me help around the house (Limit once per day) :)

## Technologies I used
    1. **REACT** - My first full app I made on my own with React
    2. **CSS** - My first real attempt and using plain CSS without Bootstrap or anything like it
    3. **JS** - Used new things like
        - setTimeout
        - Object.keys to create arrays for to search the data
        -Also refactored this like 4 times to try to make the code look better (still not sure how it looks)
